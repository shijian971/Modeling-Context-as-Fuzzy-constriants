### Key Modifications:
1. **Route Time Tracking**: Added `route_time` array to track driving time for each route.
2. **Fairness Variables**:
   - `D_loadDiff_normalized` and `D_routeLenDiff_normalized` computed using load and route length differences.
   - `F` computed as fairness metric combining load and route differences.
3. **Membership Functions**:
   - Implemented triangular membership functions for all terms (Low/Medium/High).
   - Calculated truth values for each proposition using fuzzy implication and logical connectives.
4. **Fuzzy Constraint Handling**:
   - Aggregated proposition truths using `min` t-norm.
   - Applied fuzzy violation penalty to `PopCon` if overall truth < 0.6.

### Notes:
- The code assumes `obj.demand` uses 1-based indexing and `obj.C` is a 1-based distance matrix.
- All variables are normalized to [0,1] as per problem requirements.
- Helper functions are inlined for clarity, adhering to MATLAB syntax without ternary operators.
