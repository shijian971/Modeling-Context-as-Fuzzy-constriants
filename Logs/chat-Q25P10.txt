  1 - \frac{x}{20}, & 0 \leq x \leq 20 \\
  0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases} \)

  Triangular peak at 8 drivers (0.4 normalized), spanning 4–12 drivers (0.15–0.6 normalized).  
  \( \mu_{\text{Medium}}(x) = \begin{cases} 
  \frac{x - 4}{4}, & 4 \leq x \leq 8 \\
  \frac{12 - x}{4}, & 8 < x \leq 12 \\
  0, & \text{otherwise}
  \end{cases} \)

#### **p₃: S_custAvg (High)**

  \frac{x - 0.7}{0.2}, & 0.7 \leq x \leq 0.9 \\
  \frac{1 - x}{0.1}, & 0.9 < x \leq 1 \\

### Notes:
1. **Variable Normalization:** All variables are scaled to [0,1] using their universe ranges.
2. **Membership Functions:** Implemented using if-else conditions for clarity.
3. **Penalty:** Added to `PopCon` if the aggregated truth value of all propositions falls below 0.6.
4. **Helper Functions:** Membership calculations are inline for simplicity. For better readability, you could encapsulate them in helper functions within `obj` as per the problem's requirement.

This implementation integrates fuzzy logic constraints into the routing problem while maintaining compatibility with the existing `CalObj2` framework.
